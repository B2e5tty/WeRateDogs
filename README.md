# WeRateDogs
Analyse rating from WeRateDogs twitter account.
This project focuses on wrangleing and analyzing a WeRateDogs Twitter account, that rates
people's dogs with humorous comments about the dog. These ratings almost always have a
denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10,
13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers
and has received international media coverage.
The implementation of this project is divided into 6 steps. The first step consists of gathering the
datasets from different sources like directly downloading, downloading from the internet and
using twitter API. The second step is assessing the datasets both visually and programmatically.
After the assessment is the third step, which is to clean these datasets using the assessment
documentation. Then these clean datasets are stored or exported into a file in the fourth step.
The last but not the least is incorporating insights and displaying visuals. The sixth step is to
write a report
